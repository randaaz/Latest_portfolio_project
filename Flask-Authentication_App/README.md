# Description
This Flask application is a simple web application that allows users to view articles, register, log in, create, edit, and delete articles, and manage user sessions. It uses a MySQL database to store articles and user information. The application is designed to showcase basic web development concepts using Flask, MySQL, and other related technologies.

# Technologies Used
#Flask: Flask is a micro web framework for Python used to build web applications.
MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system used for data storage.
Flask-MySQLdb: Flask-MySQLdb is a Flask extension that simplifies MySQL database connections in Flask applications.
WTForms: WTForms is a library for creating and validating web forms in Flask applications.
passlib: Passlib is a library used for password hashing and verification.
Python 3.x: The application is built using Python 3.x.
Installation
To run this Flask application on your local machine, follow these steps:

# Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone <repository_url>
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Database: Edit the app.py file to specify your MySQL database configuration. Modify the following lines with your MySQL credentials:

app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'your_username'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_password'
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'myflaskapp'
Initialize the Database: Create the necessary database tables by running the following command from the project directory:

python initialize_database.py
Run the Application: Start the Flask application:

python app.py
The application will be available at http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser.

# Usage
Visit the home page at http://localhost:5000/ to view articles.
Register an account to create and manage articles.
Log in to your account to access the dashboard for article management.
Create, edit, and delete articles as a logged-in user.
Challenges Faced
During the development of this application, the following challenges were encountered:

# Database Configuration: 
Configuring the MySQL database correctly, including setting up the schema and ensuring that the 'root' user had the necessary privileges.

# Session Management: 
Implementing user sessions and securing routes that require authentication using Flask's session management.

# Password Hashing:
Properly implementing password hashing and verification using the Passlib library to enhance security.

Form Validation: Validating user input in registration and article creation forms using WTForms to prevent data inconsistencies and security vulnerabilities.

# Debugging:
Debugging and troubleshooting any issues that arose during development, including SQL queries, route handlers, and template rendering.
